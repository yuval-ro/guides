# About

Generated by Chat-GPT 3.0:

Python Poetry is a tool and dependency management system for Python projects. It aims to simplify the process of managing project dependencies, packaging, and publishing. Poetry provides a declarative approach to dependency management, allowing you to specify your project's dependencies and their versions in a simple configuration file.

With Poetry, you can create a new Python project or manage an existing one. It helps you create a virtual environment for your project, resolve and install dependencies, manage different package versions, and handle packaging and distribution.

Here are some key features of Python Poetry:

1. Dependency Management: Poetry allows you to define your project dependencies in a human-readable format using the `pyproject.toml` configuration file. It supports both direct dependencies and development dependencies.

1. Virtual Environments: Poetry automatically creates and manages a dedicated virtual environment for your project, isolating its dependencies from the system-wide Python installation.

1. Dependency Resolution: Poetry uses a powerful dependency resolver to handle complex dependency graphs. It ensures that the versions of your project's dependencies are compatible and resolves conflicts if they arise.

1. Packaging and Publishing: Poetry provides commands to build and package your project into a distributable format, such as a wheel or a source distribution. It also offers publishing commands to easily release your project to PyPI, the Python Package Index.

1. Project Management: Poetry offers various commands for managing your project, such as creating new files, running tests, running scripts, and managing the project's metadata.

Python Poetry is an alternative to other popular Python dependency management tools like pip and virtualenv. It aims to provide a more modern and user-friendly experience for managing Python projects and their dependencies.

# Prerequisites

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

# Setup

1. Open a PowerShell (Administrator) and run the following:
    ```powershell
    (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
    ```
1. Once installation complete, hit WinKey and type "env".  
This should show the "Edit the environment variables" from the control panel - click it.

1. In the opened window dialog, click on the "Environment Variables..."  button.

1. In the opened window dialog, in the top list box ("User variables for user") find the "Path" variable - mark it and click "Edit...".

1. In the opened window dialog, click on "New" and paste the following path: %APPDATA%\Python\Scripts

1. Restart your machine for changes to take effect.

# Usage

## Project initialization

To create a new **poetry project**, run the following:
```
poetry new project-name
```  

This will scaffold a new Python project in a nested folder named "project-name":
```
project-name
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── project-name
│   └── __init__.py
└── tests
    └── __init__.py
```
The **pyproject.toml** file is a key metadata file of Poetry projects, same as package.json in Node.js.

The **poetry.lock** file is a self-maintaining dependencies list, same as package.lock in Node.js.


To initialize a pre-existing project, run the following:
```
poetry init
```

## Adding/removing dependencies

To add new Python packages to your project, say NumPy, run the following:
```
poetry install numpy
```
To remove, run the following:
```
poetry remove numpy
```
> These will automatically update the .lock file as needed.
